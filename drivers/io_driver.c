 *
 * Description:
 * This file contains the implementation of the IO driver for handling GPIO pins. 
 * It defines initialization, deinitialization, and runtime control functions for
 * configuring pin directions and reading/writing pin states. The design uses a 
 * struct-based approach to encapsulate pin-specific properties and functions, 
 * enabling flexibility and modularity.
 *
 * Revision History:
 * Version 0.0.1: 
 *   - Initial implementation with basic IO functionality.
 *   - Includes support for pin initialization, direction setting, value writing, 
 *     and value reading.
